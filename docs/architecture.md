# Architecture

## Principles

The system separates semantic judgment from deterministic state control. Agents read bounded context and produce schema-validated proposals. Normal services validate, version, persist, and commit canonical data.

## Components

- FastAPI exposes project, document import, chapter, chunk, and health endpoints.
- Pydantic schemas in `comic_agent/schemas` define all agent/service contracts.
- SQLAlchemy stores formal ids, status, version, relations, timestamps, and JSON payloads.
- PostgreSQL is the production fact source; SQLite is used only for unit tests.
- Redis, MinIO, and pgvector are reserved in infrastructure for workflow state, object storage, and later retrieval.
- Provider interfaces isolate all LLM and image model calls.

## Data Flow

TXT upload is parsed into `SourceDocumentV1`, `SourceChapterV1`, and `SourceChunkV1`. Chunks become the evidence anchor for proposals. Story proposals cannot become canonical without `CommitService` evidence validation.

## Startup Phase Boundary

This phase implements the source evidence chain, schema contracts, mock providers, API shell, database shell, docs, and tests. Full story compilation, image generation, QA repair loops, and frontend workflows are planned but not implemented.
